A Map Editor for King Arthur's Gold

Where?
------
Download the compiled .jar from <a href="https://forum.kag2d.com/resources/map-editor.173/">the KAG Forums.</a>
or build the editor from source!

How?
----
If you want to build the editor, you need to download `src`, `res` and `lib`.
Import these three folders in your Java-Project and use `KAGFrapp.jar` as import path.

The filetree should look like this:
src
  +-com.numpad.kageditor
    +-Editor.java
    +-EditorState.java
    +-...
res
  +-data
    +-img
    +-music
    +-scr
    +-scripts
lib
  +-KAGFrapp.jar

You probably won't need jbox2d.jar and the other libraries, but KAGFrapp <u>may</u> not compile without them.

How can I help?
